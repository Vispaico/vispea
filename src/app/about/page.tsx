          <p className="text-2xl text-slate-300">
          Vispea started in a Prague basement in 2019 when three friends decided that making music about street art made more sense than actually making street art.<br/>Why risk arrest when you can risk your entire music career instead?<br/><br/>
          Our process is simple: we find walls that speak louder than we ever could, take a photo, write a song about it, then slap it on a black t-shirt.<br/><br/>Some bands tour. We walk around cities with cameras and notebooks, looking suspicious.
          </p>
          <p className="text-2xl text-slate-300">
          The name &quot;Vispea&quot; comes from a drunken argument about Finnish mythology that nobody remembers correctly.<br/><br/>We&apos;re pretty sure it doesn&apos;t mean anything, which makes it perfect.

          <p className="text-2xl text-slate-300">
            Our sound is what happens when punk rock gets tired of being angry and decides to be weird instead. We&apos;ve been described as &quot;aggressively confusing,&quot; &quot;surprisingly catchy for something this stupid,&quot; and &quot;please stop sending us your demos.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-2xl text-slate-300">
            Every shirt design has a song. Every song tells a story. Most stories don&apos;t make sense, but neither does trying to spank Superboy or believing you&apos;re free while standing in a cage. We write about Kurosawa, laughing grannies, daddy issues painted on walls, and philosophical mailboxes. Because why not?

        <p className="max-w-5xl text-2xl text-slate-300">
          Black fabric. Bold prints. Zero compromise. We only make what we&apos;d actually wear, which explains why we&apos;re not rich yet. That being said, we’re not here to play nice or stack your closet—$69, shipped free, done. Wear it ‘til it’s beat, like your old tapes from ‘93.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-5xl text-2xl text-slate-300">
          Each design is a moment frozen in time—graffiti that might be painted over tomorrow, street art that says more than a thousand think pieces, walls that witnessed more than they should have. We capture it, immortalize it, and let you walk around wearing someone else&apos;s rebellion.

        <p className="max-w-5xl text-2xl font-stretch-120% text-orange-400">
          Psalm 69: &quot;Life is better when you have no Fucks to give.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-5xl text-2xl text-slate-300">
          We believe in art without permission, music without rules, and fashion without trying too hard. We believe that Lego without love is just ego, that you should listen to your inner child, and that sometimes the world just needs to shut the fuck up and be nice.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-5xl text-2xl text-slate-300">
          We&apos;re not here to change the world. We&apos;re here to put weird shit on t-shirts and write songs about it. If that accidentally means something to you, cool. If not, also cool.
        </p>

          Probably nowhere fast, but we&apos;re enjoying the ride. We&apos;ll keep making songs about walls, walls about songs, and shirts about both until someone stops us or we run out of black fabric.
